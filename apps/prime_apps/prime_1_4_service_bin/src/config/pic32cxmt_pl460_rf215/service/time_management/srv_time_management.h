  Parameters:
    None.

  Returns:
    Value of microseconds in 64 bits.

  Example:

    if ((newTimeUS - previousTimeUS) > 1000000)
    {
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    None.

/* Function:
    SYS_TIME_HANDLE SRV_TIME_MANAGEMENT_CallbackRegisterUS ( SYS_TIME_CALLBACK callback,
                        uintptr_t context, uint32_t us, SYS_TIME_CALLBACK_TYPE type )

   Summary:
        Registers a function with the time system service to be called back when the
        requested number of microseconds have expired (either once or repeatedly).

   Description:
        Creates a timer object and registers a function with it to be called back
        when the requested delay (specified in microseconds) has completed.  The
        caller must identify if the timer should call the function once or repeatedly
        every time the given delay period expires.

   Parameters:
    callback    - Pointer to the function to be called.
                  For single shot timers, the callback cannot be NULL.
                  For periodic timers, if the callback pointer is given as NULL,
                  no callback will occur, but SYS_TIME_TimerPeriodHasExpired can
                  still be polled to determine if the period has expired for a
                  periodic timer.

    context     - A client-defined value that is passed to the callback function.

    us          - Time period in microseconds.

    type        - Type of callback requested. If type is SYS_TIME_SINGLE, the
                  Callback function will be called once when the time period expires.
                  After the time period expires, the timer object will be freed.
                  If type is SYS_TIME_PERIODIC Callback function will be called
                  repeatedly, every time the time period expires until the timer
                  object is stopped or deleted.


   Returns:
        SYS_TIME_HANDLE - A valid timer object handle if the call succeeds.
                      SYS_TIME_HANDLE_INVALID if it fails.

   Example:
      Given a callback function implementation matching the following prototype:
      <code>
      void MyCallback ( uintptr_t context);
      </code>

      The following example call will register it, requesting a 500 microsecond
      periodic callback.
      <code>
     
      SYS_TIME_HANDLE handle = SRV_TIME_MANAGEMENT_CallbackRegisterUS(MyCallback, (uintptr_t)0, 
                500, SYS_TIME_PERIODIC);
      if (handle != SYS_TIME_HANDLE_INVALID)
      {
           
      }
      </code>

   Remarks:
       Will give a callback after the requested number of microseconds or longer
       have elapsed, depending on system performance. In tick-based mode, the requested
       delay will be ceiled to the next timer tick. For example, if the 
       timer tick is set to 1 msec and the requested delay is 1500 usec, a 
       delay of 2 msec will be generated.

       Delay values of 0 will return SYS_TIME_ERROR.
