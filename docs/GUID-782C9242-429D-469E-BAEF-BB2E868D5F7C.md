# G3-PLC Device/Depth Graph View

Based on the information learned from the analysis of the bootstrap protocol and routing Mesh Header, this tool is able to produce a graph with the number of nodes currently connected to the network and the maximum depth reached \(maximum number of hops to reach any device in the network\).
