# Rebuild Databases

This feature allows to reprocess an old database and update the database format. Newer versions of this software might need to do this in order to fix some bug or enable some new feature. This process does not change the original data in any way.

A typical use case is to decode ciphered databases after the log is recorded. To do so, proper key initialization must be done.
