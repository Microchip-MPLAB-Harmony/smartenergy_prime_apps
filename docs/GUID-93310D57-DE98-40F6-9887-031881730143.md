# Last Path Update for a Device

Select all LoadNG protocol messages in this log:

```
SELECT * FROM Frame WHERE (CmdType & 16383) = 4096 OR (CmdType & 16383) = 4097 OR (CmdType & 16383) = 4098
```

Or, select last path responses for a single node:

```
SELECT * FROM Frame,PREP WHERE Frame.idFrame = PREP.PREP_idframe and PREP.Originator=3 ORDER BY idFrame DESC LIMIT 1
```

As opposed to MeshHeader table, PREP only contains short address information, therefore, filter for Originator field is simply an integer.

Paths are stored in two tables: LoadNG\_ForwardPaths and LoadNG\_ReversePaths. Both tables are linked to Frame/PREP tables by a foreign key. To retrieve the forward Path for a Frame we need to join three tables like:

```
SELECT LOADng_ForwardPaths.* FROM LOADng_ForwardPaths WHERE ForwardPaths_idFrame = (SELECT idFrame FROM Frame,PREP WHERE Frame.idFrame = PREP.PREP_idframe and PREP.Originator=3 ORDER BY idFrame DESC LIMIT 1)
```

Equivalently, the reverse path statement will be:

```
SELECT * FROM LOADng_ReversePaths WHERE ReversePaths_idFrame = (SELECT idFrame FROM Frame,PREP WHERE Frame.idFrame = PREP.PREP_idframe and PREP.Originator=3 ORDER BY idFrame DESC LIMIT 1)
```

If we need the full path \(forward and reverse\) in one selection it is possible to execute a union of both selects:

```
SELECT LOADng_ForwardPaths.* FROM LOADng_ForwardPaths WHERE ForwardPaths_idFrame = (SELECT idFrame FROM Frame, PREP WHERE Frame.idFrame = PREP.PREP_idframe and PREP.Originator=3 ORDER BY idFrame DESC LIMIT 1)
UNION
SELECT * FROM LOADng_ReversePaths WHERE ReversePaths_idFrame = (SELECT idFrame FROM Frame, PREP WHERE Frame.idFrame = PREP.PREP_idframe and PREP.Originator=3 ORDER BY idFrame DESC LIMIT 1)
```
