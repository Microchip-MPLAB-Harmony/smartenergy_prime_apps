# Reception

When a PLC message is received, it is processed in the callback function `APP_PLC_DataIndCb()`. This function receives a structure of type `DRV_PLC_PHY_RECEPTION_OBJ` as a parameter containing all the available data from the message.

The callback function checks if CRC validation was OK, extracts some data about the modulation and signal received. The function checks the length of the message and sends the content and information about the signal quality to the host console.

The structure contains all the information available about the message received. The fields of the structure are:

|`pReceivedData`|Pointer to data buffer containing received frame. The received frame includes padding \(if needed\). CRC is included if the CRC capability in the PL360 is disabled|
|`time`|Reception time \(start of message\) referred to 1us PHY counter|
|`evmHeaderAcum`|Accumulated Error Vector Magnitude for header|
|`evmPayloadAcum`|Accumulated Error Vector Magnitude for payload|
|`evmHeader`|Error Vector Magnitude for header|
|`evmPayload`|Error Vector Magnitude for payload|
|`dataLength`|Length of the data buffer in bytes|
|`scheme`|Modulation scheme of the received message

|
|`frameType`|Type A, Type B or Type BC frames|
|`headerType`|Header Type of the received message|
|`rssiAvg`|Average RSSI \(Received Signal Strength Indication\)|
|`cinrAvg`|Average CNIR \(Carrier to Interference + Noise ratio\)|
|`cinrMin`|Minimum CNIR \(Carrier to Interference + Noise ratio\)|
|`berSoftAvg`|Average Soft BER \(Bit Error Rate\)|
|`narBandPercent`|Percentage of carriers affected by narrow band noise|
|`impNoisePercent`|Percentage of symbols affected by impulsive noise|
