# G3-PLC Hexa View

This view shows the hexadecimal display of the frame selected in the main view. Parts of the message are colored. The MAC header is shown in green, the MAC payload in yellow and the CRC in red. Some bytes might by uncolored, because they are the result of zero-padding of PHY layer, thus such bytes are not part of the MAC frame.
